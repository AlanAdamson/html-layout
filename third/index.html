        Ah. What the hell is a gigawatt? Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? I just wanna use the phone. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Yeah, who are you? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.
